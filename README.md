<h1 align="center">MTOTM ðŸ’¡</h1>

Many to One to Many ("MTOTM") provides an atomic swap of member tokens to meta-governance index tokens. 

This allows for many DAOs to do a swap together, thereby creating a shared token that can be used for governance of a meta governance DAO and can be used for diversification by each of the DAOs as well.

With our protocol, MTOTM enables platforms like Juicebox and others to use it as a one-stop-shop for fundraising and indexation with minimal friction.

## Why use MTOTM?

 - Treasury diversification
 - Meta-governance cababilties 
 - Indexation benefits through ownership of a single token representing multiple DAOs
 - Fundraising via ability to fund DAOs with ETH in return for meta tokens
