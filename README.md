<h1 align="center">MTOTM ðŸ’¡</h1>

Many to One to Many ("MTOTM") provides a n-way swap of DAO tokens to meta-governance index tokens. 

This allows for many DAOs to do a swap together, thereby creating a shared token that can be used for meta governance of the community of DAOS and diversification within each DAO treasury. The meta token also acts as a passive investment vehicle for investors who want exposure to DAOs without the burden of picking individuals. If DAOs are looking for funding, MTOTM can distribute investor ETH/Stablecoins, providing meta tokens in return. 

With our protocol, MTOTM supports a one-stop-shop for meta-governance and fundraising with minimal friction.

## Why use MTOTM?

 - Treasury diversification
 - Meta-governance capabilties 
 - Indexation benefits through ownership of a single token representing multiple DAOs
 - Fundraising via ability to fund DAOs with ETH in return for meta tokens

 ## How does MTOTM provide value

 Even though the right size for a DAO can always be debated, our philosophy is that smaller DAOs that solve specific problems can be more effective. Because organizations that are so fragmented can't grow the right way, meta-governance combines the best of both top-down and bottom-up decision-making. Builders who know the product best should have the most say in its development, while people with industry knowledge can help steer the ship toward more extensive benefits. A "Goldilocks" solution would be an organization (shared token) with multiple small teams (DAOS), where owners (shared token holders) provide broad view governance. Enter MTOTM, providing scaling solutions while still allowing teams with the most skin in the game a majority of governance.
